# Chatroom
The application consists of user-created chatrooms which contain messages posted by users. Each user is either a standard user or an administrator.

Features:
- Users can sign in and out, and sign up.
- Users can create new chatrooms. The creator of a chatroom can decide its name and description. No two chatrooms can have the same name.
- Users can search for existing chatrooms based on both name and description.
- Users can post messages in chatrooms. Messages are shown in order based on the time of posting.
- Users can search for messages containing a specific search term within a chatroom.
- Users can remove and edit messages they have posted.
- The creator of a chatroom can remove it and edit its name and description.
- The creator of a chatroom can create a blocklist and a passlist for the chatroom, and add and remove users from the lists.
- All users on the blocklist of a chatroom are prevented from viewing or posting messages in that chatroom.
- If a chatroom has a passlist, only users on it are allowed to view and post messages in the chatroom.
- Administrators always have full access to all chatrooms regardless of blocklists and passlists.
- Administrators can remove messages and chatrooms.
